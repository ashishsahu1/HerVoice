# HerVoice
 An app or a web application more like a blogging space where people anonymously share their traumatic experience allowing people to comment and share the story/experience.

## woman Harrashment

- Globally, 35 per cent of women have ever experienced physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence, or sexual violence by a non-partner.

- Less than 40 per cent of the women who experience violence seek help of any sort

- In Bangalore, India, over 60% of female garment workers have been intimidated or threatened with violence at work.

## why HerVoice

- Government had enforced their laws and regulations againt such Harrashments, but is it enough for the mental trauma a girls goes through when faced such situation.

- A girl can go and tell to her mother about the situtation and talk about it to get some mental relief but what about the mother herself, keeping things in mind will certainly make her stressed right.

- We all have either faced or seen such harashments and disturbing incidents right, specially in this social networking world where reaching and sending some text is jsut a matter of seconds now,

<b>Our webapp HERVOICE is a forum where any girl can post their such incident and talks to others, help others, by sharing views and ideas. The girl can choose about being an anonymous or diplaying her name.</b>
